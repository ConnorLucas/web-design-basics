<section id="purpose">
    <h3>PURPOSE</h3>  
        <p>The purpose of my portfolio website is to serve as a bridge from my work to the public in order to secure a job, broaden interest, organize projects, etc.</p>
</section>
        
<section id="audience">
    <h3>AUDIENCE</h3>
        <p>The intended audience for this website ranges from my peers and classmates to potential employers. The website should be general enough to serve anyone looking to familiarize themselves with me or my work, whether for personal or professional reasons.</p>
</section>
        
<section id="tone">
    <h3>TONE</h3>
        <p>The content of this website will be written in a formal, informative tone. When talking about my experience or background, the third-person will be used to maintain a professionally versatile front. </p>
</section>
    
<section id="primary-content">
    <h3>PRIMARY CONTENT</h3>
        <p>Being that it is essentially a portfolio, the primary content of the website would include my previous work including art and design, mainly, but also video projects and a few written essays.   </p>
</section>
    
<section id="secondary-content">
    <h3>SECONDARY CONTENT</h3>
        <p>The secondary content of this website would include information such as <i>about, contact, resume,</i> etc. While this information likely isn't what will draw visitors in from the start, it is important in that it provides the 'next steps' after viewing my work. Additionally, this area should include links to social media such as LinkedIn and Instagram.</p>
</section>
    
<section id="navigation">
    <h3>NAVIGATION</h3>
        <p>While the site is geared towards my personal portfolio, some users might be on the site strictly for other information. Because of this, the site navigation will have users arrive on a landing page with a large scale slideshow of my work below clear links to the content mentioned previously.</p>
